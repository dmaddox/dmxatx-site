Hi! This site is a growing collection of my professional work, hobbies and interests. I fill my time by collaborating with creative and technical people (are there any other kinds?) and quite enjoy it. Take a look around. If you are so inclined, strike up a conversation. I'm always happy to talk internet, movies, the FUTURE, books or really, anything!
